name: Social Protection Geospatial exercise in Guyana
status: In process
description: Utilization of multiple data sources, including internally to the ministry and to other agencies, the IDB facilitated a data collection process, digital map and AI engine that integrates high-resolution population data with social service locations, providing decision-makers with a real-time, interactive view of population density and service gaps. By mapping social program beneficiaries, existing PoP locations, and population clusters using machine learning and satellite imagery, the system generated strategic recommendations on where to expand services. For coastal regions, where populations are denser, and inland regions, where communities are more dispersed, the system delivered tailored recommendations, ensuring resources are allocated efficiently.
