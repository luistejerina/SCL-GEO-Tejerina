name: Educational supply and demand analysis in El Salvador
status: In progress
description: This project seeks to map the educational supply and analyze the demand in the transition from primary to low and high secondary school in two municipalities of El Salvador.The distribution of educational services will be identified and areas of influence between both levels will be established, highlighting areas without access to high high school.In addition, patterns of choice of centers and distances will be analyzed between them to detect possible continuity barriers.All this will be reflected on a map that will demonstrate the areas with the greatest need for educational infrastructure and the critical points of school abandonment in the transition.
