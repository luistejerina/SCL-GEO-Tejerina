description: Advanced tool for the analysis and monitoring of climate financing in operations registered with infrastructure, with filters per year, country, division and sector.It provides a clear vision of the quantity and the percentage of operations that integrate climate financing (FC) from its preparation, detailing the allocation to mitigation and/or adaptation activities.It also allows to evaluate how the amounts approved with FC can be increased in the execution phase, maximizing the impact of green infrastructure.In addition, it offers a sector analysis and access to the detailed breakdown of each project, facilitating precise and strategic management of climate financing.The projects that have green certification are geolocalized.In the future, geolocation could be extended to all projects.
