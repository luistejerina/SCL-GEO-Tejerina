name: Dashboard health units
status: Completed
description: Dashboard with the results of an applied survey in all health units in the country, from health posts to the National Tertiary Reference Hospital.At that time (2018-2019), three pollists visited each health unit and applied the standardized survey using a tablet.One of the pollsters was an architect and was responsible for evaluating the physical conditions of buildings, generating a specific report on the state of health infrastructure in the country.Another pollster was trained to review a sample of medical records in the health units and analyze the quality of the care provided (following the methodology of the SM2015), information used to report the indicators of the project outcome and to prepare the impact assessment of the project (the same survey was applied in a sample of health units at the end of the execution of the operation GY-L1058, in 2022).The third pollster verified various data, including the geographical coordinates of the Health Unit, the coverage area, the hours of operation, etc.All information is synthesized in the Dashboard.
